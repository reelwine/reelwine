RéelWine will be one of the first security authentication solution with track & trace technologies on blockchain in wine & whiskey industry. The RéelWine platform leveraging Algorand’s blockchain network provides a fully transparent supply chain from winery to consumer stopping global trading in counterfeit wine and whiskey.
RéelWine’s platform will initially focus on operating in APEC region but it is available for any liqueur maker in the industry to use regardless which country they are in. Our aim is to establish a model such that it can be adopted by worldwide liqueur maker companies to protect the industry against counterfeit liqueurs.
Counterfeits are a big concern for all wine brands, and not just for some famous brands in the world. According to fraud experts, 20% of all wine currently circulating the globe is fake.
RéelWine will solve this problem by building an Algorand blockchain powered system to track, certify bottled liqueur from legitimate winery and improve quality control. More importantly, RéelWine creates digital profile for each and every key stakeholder in the bottled liqueur supply chain which provides full transparency and largely resolve counterfeit issues impacting high end brand producers as well as food safety concern.
Given the amount of bottle liqueur volume in the market, the potential demand for this solution is extremely high and we are confident such use case can increase the market share, visibility and reputation of Algorand network.
